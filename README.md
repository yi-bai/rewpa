# Rewpa

Rewpa (Redux Reducer with Path) is a library works with Redux that makes composition of Recucers possible.
Two basic APIs of Rewpa is `createRewpa` and `rewpaMiddleware`.

With Rewpa, these tasks could be easily achieved:
- Declare reducer states,
- Compose and reuse reducer logics via Object, Array or Mapping,
- `Dispatch()` your action to a specific slice of your states,
- Using standard actions to avoid boilerplates in your code,
- Adding async actions (effects),
- Connect to your Redux everywhere in your components,
- Putting all your local states into Reducer

## Declare your reducer

### Sync Actions (Reducer)

### Async Actions (Effects)

## Compose reducers

### Standard Actions

### Standard Actions for List, Array and Mapping

### Listen to your local changes (_ON_CHANGE event)
